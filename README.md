Create graph and share them with your friends.

Input a function of x, examples: ln(x), sin(x), 1/(1-x)
and click Go to see your graph

Multiple functions will lay them over the same graph!

Input a value for x to see the tangent line at a specific point,
or drag the pointer across the graph to see how than tangent line changes
and to see possible intersections between two graphs.
